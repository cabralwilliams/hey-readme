  ## Description
  The project solicits user input to create a professional-looking README.md file.  This program significantly reduces the amount of repetitive work that is necessary to generate such a project file.

  ## Installation
  
  To use the program, the user should have node.js installed on his or her machine.  The user could then clone the repository (or individually copy the files) but then would have to make sure that inquirer is installed as a dependency.  (If inquirer is not installed, the user would have to enter either 'npm install inquirer' or 'npm i inquirer' from the command line while in the project folder.)
  
  ## Usage
  
  The user would have to navigate to the develop folder on the command line and enter either 'node index' or 'node index.js'.  From there, the user would answer each of the prompted questions, and the program will generate the README.md file in the develop folder.  If the user wishes to move the file to another location (e.g. if the README file is for a different project), the reader would be free to do so without changing this application's current README (this!).

  My contact information will be included at the end of this readme.  However, I'm not sure if any additional contribution is necessary for it at this time.
  
  
  ## Tests
  
  There are no specific tests for this application.  However, as a word of caution, this program will always overwrite the README.md file located in the Develop folder.  If you wish to compare documents, you should save any existing file in another location or under a different name before running this program.
